# SpringBoot Spark


Creating Entity Classes, Repository Interfaces, Service Classes, HTML Files, and Controllers for a list of fields remains a manual process in many industries.

This project streamlines the process, allowing you to create everything in one go. Simply provide the number of fields, along with their names and types, and it will generate all the necessary components for you.

### Prerequisites

First, create a Spring Boot application using the following URL:

[https://start.spring.io/](https://start.spring.io/)

Add the **Web, H2, Thymeleaf and JPA** dependency for quick start. (H2 is optional if you are using another database.)

Also, note the package name (Group) you provide while creating the application (for example: **com.example**)

### Generate required Classes, Interface and HTML files. 

Clone this repository to your local machine and start the server.

The URL will be:

[http://localhost:9999/](http://localhost:9999/)

Provide the **Application Name, Base package Name** you used while creating your Spring Boot application (for example: **com.example**) as mentioned above. 

Give the list of **Fields** for your Entity Class with Type and click on Generate Project. 

Extract The Zip file and Copy parent folder to your Source Directory.
